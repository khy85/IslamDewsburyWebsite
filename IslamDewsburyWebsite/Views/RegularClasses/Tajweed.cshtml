            The Noble Quran is the literal words of Allah that He revealed. It is very important, that the Quran must be read, written, and recited correctly and clearly, so as not to create any sort of ambiguity or misunderstanding whatsoever.

            What is Tajweed? &nbsp; The Arabic word Tajweed linguistically means 'proficiency' or 'doing something well'. It comes from the same root letters as the word Jayyid, which means 'good'.
            <br />
            <br />
            Concerning the matter of paying attention to the Qur’aan and learning and teaching it, the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: <strong>
                “The best of you is the one who learns the Qur’aan and teaches it.”
            </strong> (Bukhaari)
